- Man in the middle mode with a SWF distant client
- BUG : I on flash side I do it: "netConnection.objectEncoding = ObjectEncoding.AMF0", it crashs!
- To support IPV6 address!
- Check a NetGroup behavor connection without GroupSpecifier (var ng:NetGroup = new NetGroup(netConnection, "group1");)
- Decrypt error! And take in consideration Handshake 7bit size!
- Write family documentation in the Readme file
- Look the Seb Handshake strange packet with 127 bytes

- Fixed the different pb: 8192, limit UDP packet? Try maybe in MITM mode with a url very very long! one sending buffer by session is perhaps too much in a MMO case? 1000 players in FullMesh is impossibe with 8192 limit! "client.data" should perhaps not be keep in Client class (it's maybe too weight in MMO case).
