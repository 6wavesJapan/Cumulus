CumulusServer is a complet and cross-platform RTMFP server extensible by scripting way under open source [GPL license].

CumulusServer has been developed in keeping in mind the 5 following notions: *speed*, *power*, *light weight*, *cross-platform*, and *elegant code*.
CumulusServer motto if exists could be:

> For every complicated problem exists an elegant solution.

Even if there is not yet versionning release, code pushed on github is done only when CumulusServer has been tested and approved.

Actually, main stable features are:

- P2P rendez-vous service
- Live streaming
- RPC, pull, push exchanges, indeed all AMF possible exchanges between client and server
- Scripting engine to create your own application server or extends Cumulus features

All the documentation to install and to use CumulusServer is available through **[Wiki]**.

You can **help us** to enhance Cumulus in contacting me to cumulus.dev@gmail.com, else you can always make a **donation** ([us]|[eu]) for that we spent more time on it,
indeed it's not technical skills which limit us but lack of time.
